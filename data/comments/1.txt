The aplication works next way, as i understand, we get some data from Db and put them
to CSV form for further migration.

investigating this app i find a lot of calsses, all of them we could devide into few logical part:
1. abstract factory part (Factory pattern to abstract from object class. gives an instrument for creating our reader 
and writer class) - AbstractProcessor, ProcessorInterface, ReadWriteProcessor, YieldProcessor, ReaderWriterTrait
2. reader part - ReaderFactory, ReaderInterface, Product
3. writer part - Html, Stub, WriterFactory, WriterInterface, ConsoleOutout

The main value of app is its flexibility, we can easy change writer and reader without changing
global class system.
